freedomap was developed by Andrew Lester, Jonathan Oppenheimer, Sean Young and Rohan Suri for the 2020 Congressional App Challenge, largely in a vscode live share session during the months of July and October.

The video we submitted for the competition is viewable here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98RK6MXY-W8

# Mission Statement:
Protesting is your 1st amendment right. Here at freedomap, we’re building a platform to ensure that your constitutional right to protest is protected, publicized and collaborative. 

# Goal: 
freedomap is an accessible web application that allows users to document and view protest opportunities in their area. The web app will be available on mobile and desktop, and provide a simple interface for users. The web app will enable users to join protests and “see” what’s happening from anywhere, any time.
